# ID3-Decision-Tree-Post-Pruning
Implementation of ID3 Decision tree algorithm and a post pruning algorithm. from scratch in Python, to approximate a discrete valued target function and classify the test data.

Run the following command on the prompt:

python tree.py 2 4 /Users/ruskin/Documents/assignment/dataset1/training_set.csv /Users/ruskin/Documents/assignment/dataset1/validation_set.csv /Users/ruskin/Documents/assignment/dataset1/test_set.csv yes

-where 22 and 29 are values for L and K
-yes/no is to print the tree or not to

Open Accuracy.txt for report on accuracies on post pruned trees by both heuristics
